  Odds are, you are reading this because you have been asked to join the Public
  Goods Alliance with other leading Public Goods supporters.

In a world where public goods funding is not abundant and bountiful, many organizations
who believe in the importance of public goods are often looking for novel ways to
fund them.

**Gitcoin is no different.**

After years of raising and deploying capital based on community sentiment (ie,
Quadratic Funding) we recognize the need to grow the pie from which we can all
fund public goods. We grow weary from chasing individual funders to ensure the
sustainability of our collective Public Goods Funding mission (though we
recognize the importance of this practice and will continue it).

The Public Goods Network (PGN) will be a new L2, launched by an alliance of
public goods maxis who believe in funding public goods (name TBD), and who have
internalized the importance of sustaining Public Goods in our world.
