# Getting pgnETH on Sepolia PGN

The PGN testnet is a version of Sepolia, so any tokens you have on Sepolia can
be bridged over to the PGN testnet using the [bridge](/getting-started/bridge).

You can use an existing [Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to get
testnet Eth, then [bridge it to PGN Sepolia](/getting-started/bridge).
